        <h2>Christina's Gardening Website</h2>
        <p>For my Web Development course, I created a toy gardening website. It contains pictures of my garden, a fake form to sumbit information, and a picture carousel on the homepage.</p>

        <h2>Current Project</h2>
        <p>Currently, for my Introdcution to Databases course, I am working on creating a toy video game website including front end and back end. It is connected to a MariaDB database. The purpose of the website is to be an admin portal for employees so they can add new customers, addresses, products, and orders to their store.</p>
        <p>This is a group project and we are collaborating on github. It is called ChrisTy's Gameshop because his name is Tyler and my name is Christina.</p>
