        <p>Hello! My name is Christina Wilson. I am a computer science student from Oregon State University set to graduate in March 2022. I am looking to get my feet wet in the computer science field and am interested in all opportunities!</p>
        <p>So far, I have particularly liked learning web development (hence why I decided to make my personal website from scratch!).</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>So far, I have taken the following courses:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Introduction to Computer Science I and II</li>
            <li>Elements of Discrete Mathematics</li>
            <li>Computer Architeture and Assembly Language</li>
            <li>Data Structures</li>
            <li>Web Development</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>Current I am taking the following courses:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Introduction to Databases</li>
            <li>Analysis of Algorithms</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>Fun fact! I have a bachelor's degree in Biology and a doctorate degree in Pharmacy. I decided that I needed a career change and Oregon State University has a lovely post-baccehlorate degree program for students, like me, who have a bachelors degree and want another degree.</p>
